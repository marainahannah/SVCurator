## SVCurator-App 
This repository contains the code used to generate the SVCurator crowdsourcing platform. 
The app was used by over 60 structural variant curators to help develop a set of manually inpsected strucutural variants (SVs). 
The results of this study were published in the 2020 PLOS Computational Biology paper: 
[A crowdsourced set of curated structural variants for the human genome](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007933). 

The study yeilded 1235 manually curated SVs, and was generated from short, long, and linked read sequencing data from the GIAB Ashkenazi Jewish Trio son [NIST RM 8391/HG002].
These data can ultimately be used to evaluate SV callers or train machine learning models
